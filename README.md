# super-spoofer-self-leak

words from super (the creator):

After further considerment, I will end it here. Its been fun and a journey with my customers and staff team. Sorry to say superspoofer / super generator and all other products owned by me, will be closed down. Before you DM me asking for a refund, no policy states we can expire licenses whenever, which you all agree to. However products such as superspoofer and hardware spoofer will stay up the actual application, the discord servers will close and future customers wont be able to purchase. One of the actual main reasons i am doing this is from the stress of managing the server, you see when you have 100+ dms every day of little kids screaming at you like "giVe mE my pRodUcT" or like hundreds of tickets every day, then when disputes come in for no reason or discord accounts being banned for no reason. Another reason im closing is FiveM are not nice people, they patched the main method for superspoofer, and it wont come back. Another reason is people on discord thinking they own the world, such as people like Speedy or other people that crack peoples application and share them. Or people like vanity thinking there the best.

The truth,  I gained a bad reputation for the way i treat my customers. Or they way i didnt send there products straight away. I should have built  a better reputation with my customers, and this was a really bad way of starting this business. 

Im sorry this happened, however i will be doing bigger things, i am moving onto custom software, i will have my own site and own discord on new accounts. No i will not release this here, i will take a few months break then i will come and start custom development. So from here this is my last message. All discord servers has been sold/deleted. 

READ: As a apology for leaving you all, i am leaving some of my creations below in a zip file, here you can get lifetime licenses for superspoofer and hardware spoofer and a lot of accounts so get a hold of them quickly and a lot more, bot source code, desudo source code etc.
